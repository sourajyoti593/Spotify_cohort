Creating Cohorts of Songs


Project Overview


This project focuses on creating cohorts of songs to enhance song recommendations on Spotify. By performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and K-means clustering on the provided dataset, we aim to better understand the factors that group similar songs together. The dataset includes various attributes for songs by the Rolling Stones available on Spotify.


Problem Statement


In the realm of personalized content, delivering relevant recommendations is key to maintaining customer engagement. Spotify aims to create cohorts of different songs to refine its recommendation system, ensuring that each group contains similar types of songs. As data scientists, our goal is to perform EDA and K-means clustering to create these cohorts and provide insights into the features that define them.


Data Description


The dataset comprises information from Spotify's API regarding all albums by the Rolling Stones available on Spotify. Each song has a unique ID and several attributes:


•	name: The name of the song.


•	album: The name of the album.


•	release_date: The release date of the album (day, month, year).


•	track_number: The order of the song on the album.


•	id: The Spotify ID for the song.


•	uri: The Spotify URI for the song.


•	acousticness: Confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 indicating whether the track is acoustic.


•	danceability: Suitability of a track for dancing (0.0 to 1.0).


•	energy: Measure of intensity and activity (0.0 to 1.0).


•	instrumentalness: Likelihood of a track containing no vocals (0.0 to 1.0).


•	liveness: Probability that the track was performed live (0.0 to 1.0).


•	loudness: Overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB).


•	speechiness: Presence of spoken words in a track (0.0 to 1.0).


•	tempo: Overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM).


•	valence: Measure of musical positivity (0.0 to 1.0).


•	popularity: Popularity of the song (0 to 100).


•	duration_ms: Duration of the track in milliseconds.


Project Steps


1.	Initial Data Inspection and Cleaning
o	Examine the dataset to identify and rectify duplicates, missing values, irrelevant entries, and outliers.


2.	Data Refinement
o	Refine the data based on initial inspection findings to prepare it for further analysis.


3.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering
o	Utilize visualizations to recommend two albums based on the number of popular songs.
o	Analyze various song features to identify patterns.
o	Examine the relationship between song popularity and other factors.
o	Discuss the significance of dimensionality reduction techniques and provide observations.


4.	K-means Clustering
o	Determine the optimal number of clusters using methods such as the Elbow method or Silhouette analysis.
o	Apply the K-means clustering algorithm to the dataset.
o	Define and analyze each cluster based on song features.


Adding Plots


To further enhance this project, we will include various plots during the EDA and clustering phases, such as:


•	Histograms and Box Plots: To explore distributions and identify outliers for numerical features.


•	Scatter Plots: To examine relationships between features.


•	Heatmaps: For correlation analysis.


•	Elbow Method Plot: To determine the optimal number of clusters for K-means.


•	Cluster Visualizations: To depict the song cohorts and understand the clustering results.


These visualizations will provide deeper insights into the dataset and help in identifying meaningful patterns and clusters.
Conclusion


By the end of this project, we aim to have a well-defined set of song cohorts, along with comprehensive insights into the factors that influence these groupings. This will aid Spotify in improving their recommendation system, ultimately enhancing user experience.
